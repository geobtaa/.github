## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network is collectively managed by librarians and geospatial specialists at fourteen research institutions from across the Big Ten Academic Alliance.

What we do
* connect scholars across the Big Ten Academic Alliance to geospatial resources
* support the creation and aggregation of discovery-focused geospatial metadata
* provide the technology project staffing and infrastructure to build and host a geoportal
* actively participate in the development of open source geospatial technology and infrastructure
* contribute to the Big Ten Academic Alliance by sharing expertise, leveraging campus resources, and collaborating on innovative programs
